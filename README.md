# Encode2025-Project: PhishAI
'PhishAI' (phish + ai, get it) Is an AI-Powered, Blockchain-based training platform aimed to game-ify the process of detecting &amp; scouting malicious email that could be sent to you at ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE! 

<i>This project is an entry for the following bounties:</i>
* Starkware's 'AI x Gaming'
* Nethermind's 'Create your agentic future'
* Superteam UK's 'Build an AI x blockchain solution'
* Encode x Polygon x AI Grant Opportunity


# How does it work? #
## BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION: 
Get better at spotting malicious emails whilst gaining some badges along the way! Who doesn't want free stuff?! Perform different feats such as getting every single answer right, or speeding through the quiz with a still-high score, in order to be awarded with a free badge directly tied to your wallet. The possibilities are endless!

## AI-POWERED LEARNING:
Be constantly challenged by who-other but AI! AI will be used to generate completely unique emails within a certain setting, ensuring not only re-playability, but also training you for different circumstances! Will you let AI decieve you, or will you one-up this artificial brain?

## MULTI-CHAIN ACCESS:
Log in with EVM (Etherium / Polygon), Starknet or just straight-up Solana wallets. Don't let your trusted chain let you down from using this platform.
